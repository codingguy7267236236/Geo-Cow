        <h2>How far do you agree that global responses are crucial in meeting the challenges of reducing incidence of wildfires? [9 marks]</h2>
        
        <p>Global repsones such as the Paris Accords can help meet the challenges of reducing wild fires, since they aim to lead a global
            response in promoting mitiagation to climate change impacts such as wild fires which leads to cooperation of member stats leading
            to plans and solutions on how to tackle the issues which leads to well planned and coordinated responses which would lessen the 
            impacts of wild fires because more people would be evacuated from areas at risk (such as Australia). This would also allow more 
            planning to reduce environmental and habitat damage for wildlife since plans and startegies can be put in place to evacuated and 
            relocate animals to similar eco-systems and prevent massive deaths like in Australia where 80k animals died.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, global responses also pose challenges to reducing wildfires as geo-political issues stand in the way of aid and support
            since Australia denied aid from Russia due to their geo-political tensions, which this Russian support could have helped reduce 
            the impacts of the wildfires. Not only this but some causes to wildfires are arson therefore this means a national response is more
            affective as educational learning in schools can help educate individuals not to commit arson.
        </p>
        <p>In conclusion, global responses are helpful to reduce secondary impacts such as poverty and homelessness, however, nation local responses
            are more impactful at stopping the event unfolding in the first place since arson is a fuel to these fires and local sclae responses are more
            impactful and effective at prevented it.

    <h3>Essay question: "with reference to a place you have studied, evaluate the usefulness of quantitative data
      sources such as statistics
      and maps in representing the lived experience of a place."</h3>
    <p>Park Hill in Sheffield is a residential estate that was built in the 1950s and became a symbol of post-war
      optimism and social housing innovation. Over the years, the estate has undergone many changes, both physical and
      social, and has been the subject of various studies and representations. In this essay, I will explore the
      usefulness of quantitative data sources such as statistics and maps in representing the lived experience of a
      place like Park Hill, and argue that while these sources provide valuable insights into certain aspects of the
      place, they are limited in their ability to capture the full range of human experiences and emotions that make a
      place meaningful.</p>
    <p>One of the main advantages of quantitative data sources such as statistics and maps is that they can provide a
      snapshot of the physical and demographic characteristics of a place. For example, the population density, age
      distribution, income levels, crime rates, and other such measures can help to give a sense of the social and
      economic context in which a place is situated. In the case of Park Hill, statistics from the 2011 Census show that
      the estate has a relatively high population density of 95 people per hectare, compared to the average density of
      44 people per hectare for the city of Sheffield. This suggests that Park Hill is a densely populated area, which
      may have implications for the provision of public services and the quality of life of its residents.</p>
    <p>Another advantage of quantitative data sources is that they can be visualized on a map, which can help to reveal
      spatial patterns and relationships that may be difficult to discern from other types of data. For example, a map
      of Park Hill that shows the location of public amenities such as schools, parks, shops, and health centers can
      help to identify areas that may be underserved or inaccessible to certain groups of people. Similarly, a map that
      shows the distribution of crime incidents or environmental hazards such as air pollution can help to highlight
      areas of risk and vulnerability. Maps can also be used to show the historical development of a place, such as the
      original layout of Park Hill and the subsequent changes that have been made to it over time.</p>
    <p>However, while quantitative data sources can provide valuable insights into the physical and social aspects of a
      place, they are limited in their ability to capture the lived experience of the people who inhabit it. For
      example, statistics cannot convey the sense of community or belonging that residents of Park Hill may feel, nor
      can they capture the emotions and meanings that people attach to their homes and neighborhoods. Similarly, maps
      cannot show the subtle nuances of social interaction and cultural expression that make a place unique and vibrant.
      As such, it is important to recognize the limitations of quantitative data sources and to supplement them with
      qualitative methods such as interviews, observations, and ethnographic research.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, the usefulness of quantitative data sources such as statistics and maps in representing the lived
      experience of a place like Park Hill depends on the purpose and context of the analysis. While these sources can
      provide valuable insights into certain aspects of the place, they are limited in their ability to capture the full
      range of human experiences and emotions that make a place meaningful. Therefore, it is important to adopt a
      multidimensional and interdisciplinary approach that combines quantitative and qualitative methods to gain a more
      holistic understanding of a place and its inhabitants.</p>

      <h2>Explain the relationship between energy supply and physical geography of a named country or region</h2>
      <p>Physical geography such as high supplies of oil in the Middle East allows for more and easier abstraction that can expand the supply of oil for people in the middle east whilst also having a surplus to sell onto western countries for profits. However, comapred to geograhpically smaller countries with a high population density there are less oil supplies to mine to meet demand leading to energy defecit.</p>
      <p>Geographical location also can boost or hinder energy supplies for countries, for example countries deep inland such as southern Africa countries will have limits to hydro-electric power as the ocean and large amounts of water supplies are geographically far away. Whereas, nations such as Norway are close to the ocean therefore, hydro-electric power is easily obtainable and more efficient therefore this gives them more options towards energy supplies than inland countries.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, physical geography can both bolster and hinder nations energy supplies depending on where they are located.</p>

      <h2 id="resourcecasestudy">Assess the relative importance of physical and human factors in creating water conflicts at different scales. [20 marks]</h2>
      <p>Physical factors are natural processes such as change in weather patterns or temperature changes drive changes in water supplies. Human factors are human processes that impact water supplies which include abstraction, mining operations, etc.</p>
      <p>Physical factors were the driving factors to the Aral sea conflict between Uzbekistan and Kazakstan, due to high evaporation rates causing the Aral sea to retreat massively from 1960 to 2000 leading to conflicts of the Aral sea water source as Uzbekistan's economy is focussed around cotton so alot of water is required for cotton farming whilst Kazakstan needed water for fish farming as they had already closed fishing ports due to the shrinking sea. Therefore, due to these shortages Kazakstan and Uzbekistan came into conflict with each other over the water supply of the Aral Sea since both need water for their primary economic sectors of fishing and cotton farming as well as infant mortality rates rising to 75 per 1000 due to a lack of supply. Therefore, because each nation is desperate for water in order to survive therefore conflict will always arise when people need a fundamental resource such as water. Climate change is another factor that is causing water patterns to change leading to water reserves to deplete at quicker rates such as when the UK had to impose a hosepipe ban in 2022 due to low reserves from prolonged heatwave.</p>

      <p>However, human factors such as economic activity can lead to conflicts for water supplies, such as Coca Colas economic actvity in Kerala (India). This is because over-abstraction of local aquifers to support in the manufacturing of coca cola products leading to farmers having a reduced amount of water to use for farming wihich in turn harms farmers economic livlihoods which again makes people desperate leading to conflict to get basic needs. Coca Colas operations led to the water table falling 260ft below surface level making it more expensive and difficult to abstract water. Coca Colas operations also contaminated water supplies which limited the water supplies in India for ordinary folks since locals don't have the technology to abstract lower level water supplies unlike TNCs such as Coca Cola.</p>
      
      <p>In conclusion, I would say human factors are more impactful in creating water conflicts than physical factors, as overtime water levels have recovered once human operations have stopped abstracting. Whereas, overabstractions from humans has been a major driving force in depleting water supplies which as a result makes people desperate to a basic neccissity of water and if they are unable to easily get it, history shows they will do anything to get it in order to survive.</p>

      <p><b>With reference to one or more seismic event(s) that you have studied, assess the importance of past and present processes of development in understanding the impact of associated hazards?</b></p>
      <p>Using past experiences such as looking at the responses for seismic events such as the Haiti earthquake allows for nations to evaluate the pros and cons of how they mitigated and responded to the event. This is because the lack of poor planning and dependency on developed nations can be looked at by other nations of what not to do and be self sufficient but also see the importance in having strong geo-political connections for aid, especially if they are a under-developed nation.</p>
      <p>However, using past experiences may not help develop understanding because each seismic event is different so nations can evaluate the Tohuku event where it shows that having earthquake proof buildings was effective for Tohoku however, nations could take similar actions to this but if it's a ritcher scale 9 seismic earthqauke then these resistant buildings could collapse and cause alot more secondary deaths to populations. On top of this different locations could have unforseen secondary events that trigger from the primary seismic event such as liquefaction or tsunamis that may not be present in evry area.</p>
<p>Therefore, historical events can help give you some basic knowledge and ideas on how to mitigate and respond to these events. But each event is unique and different so sometimes going with the flow and making decisions after they happen is required. So in conclusion, past experiecnes give you some brief guidance and understanding of seismic events but you still need to evaluate your specific situation to help you mitigate and repsond.</p>

    <section id="With reference to a river catchment that you have studied, assess the potential factors which can impact upon the flood hydrograph">
      <b>With reference to a river catchment that you have studied, assess the potential factors which can impact upon the flood hydrograph? [20 Marks]</b>
      <p>Flood hydrographs are data visualisation of the relationship between rainfall and time to help show infiltration rates in an area. Factors which can affect the hydrograph are infiltration rates, geology of the land and human intervention to name a few. River Eden is an example of a river catchment that has experienced human and natural processes that have shaped its hydrograph over time.</p>
      <p>Human impacts can impact hydrographs in different ways, such as in the River Eden basin, human intervention such as the clearing away of vegetation farming for cattle farming and clearing of forests for housing has impacted the hydrograph by transforming its shape from a base flow hydrograph to a more flashy hydrograph. This is because the deforestation of trees around the river has led to less interception as well as less absorption from roots of these trees which leads to less lag time creating higher peak flow than normal and after a quicker time leading to more water run-off and flooding. Human intervention of overabstraction of the London Basin led to lower base flows than usual and longer lag times as less water was stored in the basin leading to less flooding and increasing the risk of drought as there was less run-off because of over abstraction.</p>
      <p>However, human factors aren't the only factors that impact hydrographs because natural processes such as extreme weather events such as storm Desmond in the river Eden led led to heavier rainfall than usual in the region leading to shorter lag times and higher peak flows in the river because the roots and interception rates of the trees cannot abosrb or intercept the amount coming down creating a flashy hydrograph as a result. Geology of the land is another factor affecting hydrographs as impermeable rocks will reduce lag times due to creating greater water run-off as well as more permeable rocks allowing more water absorption reducing peak flow and increasing lag times leading to a more base flow hydrograph. Natural factors can also include recovery processes, such as the London basin recovering 3m per year since the end of the brewing operations in the region which led to the basin recovering to close to normal levels bring the hydrograph back to a base flow graph shapes.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, I would argue that in the short term, human impacts have more of an impact on hydrographs as they can cause them to become more flashy and steep in a short period of time, as well as the antithesis where hydrographs become alot more flat than normal due to processes such as overabstractions. However, in the long term I would argue that natural processes can bring river systems back to equlibrium and restore the hydrographs to normal levels.</p>

    <section id="Explain the factors responsible for one of the following: energy conflict, a mineral ore conflict or water conflict you have studied [9 marks]">
      <h2>Explain the factors responsible for one of the following: energy conflict, a mineral ore conflict or water conflict you have studied [9 marks]</h2>
      
      <p>Geography of nations surrounding the Aral sea was prehaps the biggest factor to water conflicts since the geographic location of Uzbekistan & Kazakstan is far inland (landlocked) and far away from the oceans making water supplies very limited compared to nations such as the UK. Therefore, with this conflicts are likely to brew over small water supplies which is what happened between Uzbekistan & Kazakstan as water is an essential resource to survive and fuel most day to day activities. Natural processes such as climate change either increases or decreases supplies during warmer and cooler periods, respectively, which when the climate is warmer water supplies are limited due to high rates of evapotranspiration since more water is held in the atmosphere limited the supply in the biosphere causing for conflicts in highly dense areas with defecit supply.</p>

      <p>Human activity is another big factor in being responsible for water conflict in the Aral Sea, as the already limited supply between Uzbekistan & Kazakstan is further limited due to overabstraction of water from the Aral has led to it drying up which this increasing decline in water resources raises tensions further between the 2 nations as already mentioned water is an essential resource so people will do anything they must to survive and therefore become less afraid of conflict leading to war over the Aral. Not only this but human greed and an increasing population across the world and between the 2 nations puts alot more strain on the water defecits the 2 nations are experiencing putting tensions at an even higher rate.</p>
      
      <p>In conclusion, I would say that human activity is the biggest driving factor to water conflicts, since mankind is known for being greedy which inevitably leads to conflict down as well as overabstraction activites have caused rivers and oceans to dry out limiting supplies globally which these activities far outweigh the natural processes or physcial factors have on catalyzing water conflicts.</p>

    <section id="The global trade in energy resources defines geopolitics more widely, to what extent do you agree? [9 marks]">
      <h2>The global trade in energy resources defines geopolitics more widely, to what extent do you agree? [9 marks]</h2>
      
      <p>The OPEC trade block has been responsible for monitoring and managing oil supplies and trade between the Middle East and the rest of the world to ensure sustainable prices and fair trade across the world in regards to oil. OPEC was established for the reason of ensuring sustainable prices and fair trade between nations, which were geo-political issues, so therefore, this has led to some increased awareness of geo-politics.</p>

      <p>Trade in energy resources, particular the USA, has helped define energy security as a geo-politcial issue, since under the Trump Administration energy independence was a big issue for the USA and it became more widely known it was a geo-political issue as energy trade deals such as with NAFTA have been mainstream issues since 2017.</p>

      <p>In conclusion, I would say that in the last 5 years energy has helped define geo-politics more widely than the previous 5 years so it is fair to say that energy has helped make geopolitics more widely known. Therefore, it does appear energy is taking geo-politics more global into the future.</p>
