        <p>Intra plate boundary volcanic island chain</p>
        <p>An intra-plate boundary volcanic island chain is a chain of islands that forms in the middle of a tectonic plate, away from the plate boundaries. These islands are usually created by volcanic activity, which occurs when molten rock, or magma, rises from the Earth's mantle and erupts onto the surface.

            The magma that forms these islands is usually sourced from deep within the Earth's mantle, where high temperatures and pressures cause rocks to melt. As the magma rises towards the surface, it may encounter pockets of water or other volatiles, which can cause it to erupt explosively.
            
            Over time, as the magma continues to erupt, it can build up layers of solidified lava and ash, eventually creating a new island. As the tectonic plate continues to move over the magma source, new islands can be formed in a chain, as older islands move away from the hotspot and cool, while new ones form in their place.
            
            An example of an intra-plate volcanic island chain is the Hawaiian Islands, which were formed by a hotspot beneath the Pacific Plate.</p>

      <h2>Water and Carbon</h2>
      <p><b>Perculation</b> - water moving downwards due to gravity</p>
      <p><b>Permeability</b> - How easy for water to infiltrate something. e.g. a rock</p>
      <p><b>Stemflow</b> - leaves capture water and let it trickle down. (this reduces lag time)</p>
      <p><b>Evaportranspiration</b> - water loss from vegetation through evaporation from surface or respiration</p>
      <p><b>Sequester</b> - take in carbon e.g. trees sequester carbon</p>
      <p><b>Pastoral farming</b> - cattle farming</p>
      <p><b>Arable farming</b> - ploughing and irrigation crops</p>

      <p><b>Flow resources</b> - sustainable resources such as water, wind, solar</p>
      <p><b>Finite</b> - supply that has limited supply</p>
      <p><b>Economic scarcity</b> - lack of resource due to economic factors</p>
      <p><b>Physical scarcity</b> - lack of resource due to physical attributes</p>

      <p>Liquefaction - destabilises water causing quicksand effect.</p>
      <p>
Liquefaction is when soil becomes temporarily like a liquid during an earthquake. It happens because the ground shaking causes water-saturated soil to lose its strength and act like a liquid. This can lead to the sinking or shifting of buildings and structures. Liquefaction is a significant concern in areas with loose, sandy soil or reclaimed land.</p>
